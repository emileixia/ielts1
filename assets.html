  <h1>Speed Reading</h1>
  <p><br />
    In the reading section of the IELTS test, you have a very  limited time to read and understand three complex passages.</p>
  <p>    In this activity, you will be shown twenty short excerpts  with only six seconds to read and understand each one. You will then be asked a  question on what you have just read.<br />
    <br />
    HINT: Focus on key information, such as facts, figures and  main ideas.</p>
